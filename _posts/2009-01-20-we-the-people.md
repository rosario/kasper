"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution#cite_note-0"> </a>promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

These words serve as the Preamble to the Constitution which was adopted 221 years ago, give or take a few months, and created the United States of America.  Though the Constitution has been amended on a few occasions, these principles still stand as a shining ideal for what I hope is a country that still believes in that ideal.

The question I'm asking myself on the day of President Obama's inauguration is this:  have I done anything recently to contribute to the formation of a perfect union?  Have you?
